## Game Explanation

### 1. How to start the game?
First, there is an input box at the top where you can enter your name. After clicking the "Start the Game" button, your name data will be stored.  
When you are ready to play, click the stargate in the middle of the grid to see the player figure appear.

### 2. How to move?
To move, click the "Move" button. The cells you can select will be highlighted in the same row and column where the player is standing.  
Click the cell where you want to move, and it will be highlighted with an orange color, indicating that you are now standing on that cell.

### 3. How to achieve Digging?
To dig, click the "Dig" button, then click the cell where you are currently standing (highlighted in orange).  
If there is a clue or part there, it will be revealed. If there is nothing, the cell will remain unchanged, and you should move on to explore further!

### 4. The end of the game
If you run out of water, an alert will inform you that the game is over, and further clicks will be disabled.  
If you find all three parts before running out of water, an alert will congratulate you: "Congratulations! You've found all parts and won the game!"
